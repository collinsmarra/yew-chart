# Yew Charting Library

`yew-chart` is a collection of components that can be assembled to form charts
for the [Yew framework](https://github.com/yewstack/yew).

Here is a soil moisture/rainfall chart that has been produced using this library:

Here's another chart produced by this library, representing what is known as ["Delta-T"](http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/deltat.shtml):

<p align="center"><img src="./images/delta-t.png" alt="Delta-T chart" width="70%" /></p>

By leveraging these SVG-based components many types of charts can be formed
with a great deal of flexibility. The library is intended as a toolkit that
provides conveniences for rendering chart primitives. These primitives can
be regarded at a similar level as SVG's primitives i.e. lines, polygons etc.

## Example Plots

Two basic projects are given in the `examples` folder.

### Line Chart

`examples/basic` is configured to output a basic line chart:

...and here's the essence of the Yew view method code that was used to generate it:

```rust
fn view(&self, _ctx: &Context<Self>) -> yew::Html {
    html! {
        <svg class="chart" viewBox={format!("0 0 {} {}", WIDTH, HEIGHT)} preserveAspectRatio="none">
            <HorizontalSeries
                series_type={horizontal_series::SeriesType::Line}
                name="some-series"
                data={Rc::clone(&self.data_set)}
                data_labels={Some(Rc::clone(&self.data_set_labels))}
                horizontal_scale={Rc::clone(&self.horizontal_axis_scale)}
                horizontal_scale_step={Duration::days(2).num_seconds() as f32}
                vertical_scale={Rc::clone(&self.vertical_axis_scale)}
                x={MARGIN} y={MARGIN} width={WIDTH - (MARGIN * 2)} height={HEIGHT - (MARGIN * 2)} />

            <VerticalAxis
                name="some-y-axis"
                orientation={vertical_axis::Orientation::Left}
                scale={Rc::clone(&self.vertical_axis_scale)}
                x1={MARGIN} y1={MARGIN} y2={HEIGHT - MARGIN}
                tick_len={TICK_LENGTH}
                title={"Some Y thing".to_string()} />

            <HorizontalAxis
                name="some-x-axis"
                orientation={horizontal_axis::Orientation::Bottom}
                scale={Rc::clone(&self.horizontal_axis_scale)}
                x1={MARGIN} y1={HEIGHT - MARGIN} x2={WIDTH - MARGIN}
                tick_len={TICK_LENGTH} />

        </svg>
    }
}
```

### Bar Chart

Using the same Yew view method code as above, `series_type` within the `HorizontalSeries` tag can be edited to display a bar chart instead by using the `Bar` keys.

```rust
<HorizontalSeries series_type={horizontal_series::SeriesType::Bar} ... />
```

<p align="center"><img src="./images/bar-chart-30px.png" alt="A bar chart" width="70%" /></p>

### Scatter Plot

`examples/scatter` is configured to output a basic scatter plot. The method by which this is accomplished is slightly different to that of the `Line` and `Bar` charts.

Instead of using the separate `SeriesType` key to select a scatter plot, the scatter plot is created by taking advantage of the `data_labels` property within `HorizontalSeries`.

Since each label by default is composed of a circle and a textbox, a dataset of labels is created within `main.rs`, where for each datapoint that <em>shouldn't</em> have a label, that label is left empty.

```rust
//A label that will only show a point
(
    start_date.timestamp() as f32,
    1.0,
    horizontal_series::label(""),
),

//A label with text "Label"
(
    start_date.add(Duration::days(4)).timestamp() as f32,
    5.0,
    horizontal_series::label("Label"),
),
```

As such, the scatter plot is a series of labels, rather than a specific dataset.

<p align="center"><img src="./images/scatter-plot.png" alt="A scatter plot" width="70%" /></p>

If it is desired that a `Line` or `Bar` chart be added to the scatter plot, this may be added by providing data in `data_set`, as in the previous examples.
